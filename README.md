# PPE Memory Challenge Game

A 2D browser-based memory and logic game that teaches players how to correctly use personal protective equipment (PPE) based on the hazards present at different work sites. The game is designed to be educational, interactive, and engaging for all audiences.

## Game Description

In this game, the player selects a character (Male or Female) and navigates through multiple levels, each representing a different job site such as a construction zone, a chemical lab, or an electrical room.

For each site:
- The player must select the correct PPE required for that level.
- If they equip the wrong gear, a hazard animation plays and they are reset to level 1.
- If the player correctly equips PPE for all sites, they win the game.

This project uses HTML, CSS (Flexbox), and JavaScript DOM manipulation only.

## Why This Game?

As a student interested in engineering and workplace safety, I wanted to create something meaningful that reflects real-world hazard awareness â€” especially in high-risk environments like construction, labs, and electrical work. This game simulates that challenge in a fun, memory-based way.
